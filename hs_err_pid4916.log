# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 442499072 bytes. Error detail: G1 virtual space
# Possible reasons:
#   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
#   This process is running with CompressedOops enabled, and the Java Heap may be blocking the growth of the native heap
# Possible solutions:
#   Reduce memory load on the system
#   Increase physical memory or swap space
#   Check if swap backing store is full
#   Decrease Java heap size (-Xmx/-Xms)
#
#  Out of Memory Error
